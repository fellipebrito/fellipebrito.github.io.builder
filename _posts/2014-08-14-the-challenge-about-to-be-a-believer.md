I went to one of the biggest ruby conferences in the world, which happened last april in Chicago. Everyone who I look up to was there. The best developers, speakers and entrepreneurs&#8230; the brightest and most creative minds from my community were there to share their thoughts.

I felt really small surrounded by so many good people. Of course, it was a personal inspiration to get better, study more and to improve myself and my team&#8217;s work quality.

Putting aside all this tech stuff, something caught my attention. As I posted before here in my blog, I&#8217;m a statistics lover. Thus, when I saw that they had a yearly survey used to measure different aspects of our community, I promptly filled it and checked the last years results to verify. [http://www.ruby-survey.com/stats].

A lot of tech data grabbed my attention, I talk about them every blue moon in my other blog (the one I use to write about code [<a href="http://code.fellipebrito.com/" target="_blank">http://code.fellipebrito.com/</a>]). However, in this post I&#8217;d like to talk about something else: **&#8220;What are your religious beliefs?&#8221;**. These numbers are shocking for a country that is considered a christian one:

- back in 2012  we were **19%**monotheists, a decrease of **4% **since 2009.  
- also in 2012  we were **68%** atheists or agnostics, an increase of **6% **since 2008.

This year, in a small event with approximately 40  tech professionals that sometimes share the same project I work on, I was the only one to answer the &#8220;spiritual status&#8221; as: **I&#8217;m a believer**

When I defined this situation as a &#8220;challenge&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/fellipeeduardo/status/459763556112535554" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/fellipeeduardo/status/459763556112535554</a>], I received an amazing question from Roy [<a href="https://twitter.com/roy" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/roy</a>] about what would be &#8220;so challenging&#8221;. I have to admit that his question made this challenge even bigger. I will try to explain myself in the next lines.

What one can feel from most of conversations, blog articles and social media posts, is that it is a good &#8220;status&#8221; to be an atheist or agnostic. It is a synonym of being smart. Paraphrasing what Descartes said, &#8220;*I&#8217;m smart, therefore I&#8217;m atheist&#8221;.*

I made an experiment, sending a text message to all my contact friends saying &#8220;God is not dead&#8221;, I picked two answers that I received to show my point:  
- If he&#8217;s not, he certainly doesn&#8217;t give a shit about Brazil;  
- That&#8217;s not what Nietzsche said.

The countless evangelical churches affirmations and their catastrophic acts in the last 50 years make this even worse. We can certainly affirm that a believer&#8217;s brain is smaller than Homer Simpson&#8217;s brain.

Of course I forced a little bit in the above two sentences, but, mutatis mutandis, that&#8217;s exactly what we see &#8220;being thought out loud&#8221; in every social media thread.

While I was shocked with the conference survey results, other folks celebrated it: &#8220;I love to see #atheism winning in the #ruby community :: #railsconf #NonFiction #Science #Facts&#8221; [<a href="https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352</a>].

I&#8217;m always trying to live my faith. I am almost sure 100% of my friends and colleagues heard at least once about my faith. Often I share my faith details with close friends. And I try to answer everyone whenever someone asks me why do I believe.

I really respect most of these folks. They are capable professionals and entrepreneurs. Excellent people from whom I can always learn something new, and it is always challenging to share with them why I believe in the crucified carpenter, in the incarnate God, in the Genesis and in the final judgement.

Not a few times I took notes from their logical questions and I found myself researching the answers with people who are more experienced and smarter than me.

I&#8217;m far away from requesting everyone to follow my religion. And I&#8217;m positive I don&#8217;t have the answer for every question (*Maybe 42? #nerd*)

However, living in a world with no faith and no post-life hope; In a fully of reasoning and fact-based community; In an environment where you can fix any issue with some logical cod;. In a country where suicide numbers get higher and higher; In a society where a neighbor is importante just in case he or she can give you something back&#8230; I feel myself challenged to continue to be a believer and share it.

So, answering Roy&#8217;s question: &#8221;What&#8217;s the challenge you&#8217;re facing exactly? Do others not take your code seriously?&#8221;

It is easy to make sure other developers take my code seriously when my projects are reporting both simplecov 100% code coverage and CodeClimate an A grade.

What is challenging here, is trying to offer something deeper than my logical explanations when some friend needs hope rather than facts.

It is challenging to be a living evidence from something that is everyday more outdated, a proof of &#8220;lack of intelligence&#8221; and considered to be a &#8220;superstition&#8221; .

It is challenging to be a spicy seasoning in a world that prefers &#8220;3 minutes, pre made recipes&#8221;.

*The challenge, as was brilliantly interpreted by Jodie Foster, in the movie who adapted Carl Sagan&#8217;s book &#8220;Contact&#8221;, is to try to be quiet&#8230; *

*&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t. I&#8230; had an experience&#8230; I can&#8217;t prove it, I can&#8217;t even explain it, but everything that I know as a human being, everything that I am tells me that it was real! I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever&#8230; A vision&#8230; of the universe, that tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant and how&#8230; rare, and precious we all are! A vision that tells us that we belong to something that is greater then ourselves, that we are \*not\*, that none of us are alone! I wish&#8230; I&#8230; could share that&#8230; I wish, that everyone, if only for one&#8230; moment, could feel&#8230; that awe, and humility, and hope. But&#8230; **That continues to be my challenge**.&#8221;*
