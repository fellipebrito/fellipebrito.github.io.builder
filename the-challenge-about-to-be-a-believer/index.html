<p>I went to one of the biggest ruby conferences in the world, which happened last april in Chicago. Everyone who I look up to was there. The best developers, speakers and entrepreneurs… the brightest and most creative minds from my community were there to share their thoughts.</p>

<p>I felt really small surrounded by so many good people. Of course, it was a personal inspiration to get better, study more and to improve myself and my team’s work quality.</p>

<p>Putting aside all this tech stuff, something caught my attention. As I posted before here in my blog, I’m a statistics lover. Thus, when I saw that they had a yearly survey used to measure different aspects of our community, I promptly filled it and checked the last years results to verify. <a href="http://www.ruby-survey.com/stats" target="_blank">Ruby Stats</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of tech data grabbed my attention, I talk about them every blue moon in my other blog (the one I use to write about code <a href="http://code.fellipebrito.com/" target="_blank">http://code.fellipebrito.com/</a>]). However, in this post I’d like to talk about something else: <strong>“What are your religious beliefs?”</strong>. These numbers are shocking for a country that is considered a christian one:</p>

<ul>
  <li>back in 2012  we were <strong>19%</strong>monotheists, a decrease of **4% **since 2009.</li>
  <li>also in 2012  we were <strong>68%</strong> atheists or agnostics, an increase of **6% **since 2008.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year, in a small event with approximately 40  tech professionals that sometimes share the same project I work on, I was the only one to answer the “spiritual status” as: <strong>I’m a believer</strong></p>

<p>When I defined this situation as a <a href="https://twitter.com/fellipeeduardo/status/459763556112535554" target="_blank">“challenge”</a>, I received an amazing question from <a href="https://twitter.com/roy" target="_blank">Roy</a> about what would be “so challenging”. I have to admit that his question made this challenge even bigger. I will try to explain myself in the next lines.</p>

<p>What one can feel from most of conversations, blog articles and social media posts, is that it is a good “status” to be an atheist or agnostic. It is a synonym of being smart. Paraphrasing what Descartes said, “<em>I’m smart, therefore I’m atheist”.</em></p>

<p>I made an experiment, sending a text message to all my contact friends saying “God is not dead”, I picked two answers that I received to show my point:
- If he’s not, he certainly doesn’t give a shit about Brazil;
- That’s not what Nietzsche said.</p>

<p>The countless evangelical churches affirmations and their catastrophic acts in the last 50 years make this even worse. We can certainly affirm that a believer’s brain is smaller than Homer Simpson’s brain.</p>

<p>Of course I forced a little bit in the above two sentences, but, mutatis mutandis, that’s exactly what we see “being thought out loud” in every social media thread.</p>

<p>While I was shocked with the conference survey results, other folks celebrated it: “I love to see #atheism winning in the #ruby community :: #railsconf #NonFiction #Science #Facts” [<a href="https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352</a>].</p>

<p>I’m always trying to live my faith. I am almost sure 100% of my friends and colleagues heard at least once about my faith. Often I share my faith details with close friends. And I try to answer everyone whenever someone asks me why do I believe.</p>

<p>I really respect most of these folks. They are capable professionals and entrepreneurs. Excellent people from whom I can always learn something new, and it is always challenging to share with them why I believe in the crucified carpenter, in the incarnate God, in the Genesis and in the final judgement.</p>

<p>Not a few times I took notes from their logical questions and I found myself researching the answers with people who are more experienced and smarter than me.</p>

<p>I’m far away from requesting everyone to follow my religion. And I’m positive I don’t have the answer for every question (<em>Maybe 42? #nerd</em>)</p>

<p>However, living in a world with no faith and no post-life hope; In a fully of reasoning and fact-based community; In an environment where you can fix any issue with some logical cod;. In a country where suicide numbers get higher and higher; In a society where a neighbor is importante just in case he or she can give you something back… I feel myself challenged to continue to be a believer and share it.</p>

<p>So, answering Roy’s question: ”What’s the challenge you’re facing exactly? Do others not take your code seriously?”</p>

<p>It is easy to make sure other developers take my code seriously when my projects are reporting both simplecov 100% code coverage and CodeClimate an A grade.</p>

<p>What is challenging here, is trying to offer something deeper than my logical explanations when some friend needs hope rather than facts.</p>

<p>It is challenging to be a living evidence from something that is everyday more outdated, a proof of “lack of intelligence” and considered to be a “superstition” .</p>

<p>It is challenging to be a spicy seasoning in a world that prefers “3 minutes, pre made recipes”.</p>

<p><em>The challenge, as was brilliantly interpreted by Jodie Foster, in the movie who adapted Carl Sagan’s book “Contact”, is to try to be quiet… </em></p>

<p><em>“Because I can’t. I… had an experience… I can’t prove it, I can’t even explain it, but everything that I know as a human being, everything that I am tells me that it was real! I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever… A vision… of the universe, that tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant and how… rare, and precious we all are! A vision that tells us that we belong to something that is greater then ourselves, that we are *not*, that none of us are alone! I wish… I… could share that… I wish, that everyone, if only for one… moment, could feel… that awe, and humility, and hope. But… <strong>That continues to be my challenge</strong>.”</em></p>
